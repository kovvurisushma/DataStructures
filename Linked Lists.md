##Linked Lists

### Problems on Single Linked List
Usually these are the main variations in linked list
 - basic operations like insert/delete
 - problems based on finding min element and reversing the second half
 - in case if reversing the stack changes the other linked list then use stack
 - using slow and fast pointers (FLYOD'S CYCLE DETECTION ALGORITHM)

 Some important problems to solve
 1. Insert element at X position
 2. Inser element in sorted linked list
 3. length of LL or print elements of LL in reverse order
 4. Delete element at any position in linked list
 5. Remove duplicates in sorted LL
 6. Reversing a linked list
 7. Find Mid element
 8. Merge 2 sorted LL's
 9. Merge Sort/ Quick Sort or sorting algorithms on LL
 10. Palindrome LL's or not
 11. Add 2 LL's
 12. Given 2 LL's find the intersection point between them
 13. Detect loop in LL
