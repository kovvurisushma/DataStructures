Problem Statement: Find the Middle element in the linked list, given a variable lower indicating which mid value to return in case of even number of elements,
                   if lower is true then return lower mid else return higher mid

Solution:

struct Node{
  int val;
  Node* next = val;
}

Node* getMid(Node* head) {
  Node* slow = head;
  Node* fast = head;
  Node* prev = NULL;
  int n = lengthOfLL(head);
  while(fast && fast -> next) {
    prev = slow;
    slow = slow -> next;
    fast = fast -> next -> next;
  }
  if(n % 2 == 0 && lower) return prev;
  return slow;
}
